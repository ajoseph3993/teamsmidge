			<p class="marginleftclass">"After a series of mysterious signs appeared in the window of the former Hotei Sushi at 1290 9th Ave., brothers Adar and Saadi Halil have dispelled the mystery and unveiled a new ice cream shop called Hometown Creamery. According to Adar, opening a business at 9th & Irving fulfilled a long-term aspiration... <a href="https://hoodline.com/2015/07/hometown-creamery-brings-homemade-ice-cream-to-the-inner-sunset"> Read More</a></p>

		<p class="marginleftclass">"There is no question that the Castro has too many cafes, or that Russian Hill has too much beige, but San Francisco can probably never have too much ice cream. With a couple of exceptions, artisanal dairy desserts have clung to the precincts east of Twin Peaks, but the Inner Sunset’s ever-denser foodie corridor now has its own: the fraternally run Hometown Creamery, on Ninth Avenue at Irving...<a href="https://archives.sfweekly.com/foodie/2015/08/12/hometown-creamery-goes-to-great-lengths-for-its-ice-cream"> Read More</a></p>

	<p class="marginleftclass"> SF Hometown Creamery</p>
	<p class="marginleftclass"> This brand new spot just opened its Inner Sunset doors in this month. It is run by two brothers with a passion for ice cream and the neighborhood (one of the brothers was determined to end up on this exact block since they hatched the idea, 5 years ago). In addition to creative, house-made flavor combinations, such as candied orange peel, pistachio and almond, Hometown Creamery makes their ice creams completely from scratch (most purchase a premade vanilla base) so they had to get a pasteurizer’s license and build a specific sanitized room for the process. We suggest stopping in for a taste of their hard work!...<a href="http://redtri.com/san-francisco/the-best-ice-cream-in-the-bay-area/">Read More</a></p>
